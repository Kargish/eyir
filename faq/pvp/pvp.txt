**__FAQ__**

**Q**: Should I play Arms or Fury for arena?
**A**: Arms is currently one of the best melees for competitive PvP, while fury is unfortunately among the weakest. 

**Q**: What is best covenant for PvP?
**A**: Kyrian and Venthyr are currently tied for the position as best covenant. Venthyr is slightly stronger in 2v2.
Venthyr = Kyrian > Night Fae > Necrolord

**Q**: What is the best legendary?
**A**:
       Unhinged = General legendary, good in almost any situation
       Misshapen Mirror = Good vs caster cleaves such as MLX, Shadowplay, Scatter Cleave or ele+boomkin
       Sephuz = For defensive plays where stalling is key and you're the kill target, for an example vs RMP
       Exploiter = Great alternative to Unhinged for Venthyr warriors

**Q**: What are the stats I should go for?
**A**: Versatility > 30% haste > Mastery > Critical Strike > Haste
       If you play Venthyr with Exploiter, your stat priority can also work as Versatility > Critical Strike > Mastery > Haste

**Q**: I have reason to stick with another covenant/legendary, will this prevent me from reaching my rating goals?
**A**: You can reach at least gladiator with any covenant as arms, and obtain the elite set as both arms and fury with any covenant. If you're interested in pushing high end gladiator or rank 1, it's recommended you switch covenant to Kyrian.

**Q**: How do I simulate my character for PvP?
**A**: You cannot simulate for PvP, the nature of PvP is too dynamic and have too many variables to be able to produce any useable results.
